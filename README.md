# Getting Started with Sliding Triangles Background

This project demonstrates a background effect that changes on every page change. The effect shows (parts of) triangles in different colours, sliding left and right as the user navigates through the app.

It is a pure frontend application build with React Hooks using Material UI components and uses the GSAP library for the animation [gsap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gsap)

## Modifying the effects

It is easy to modify certain elements to change the behaviour of the background and components. 
1. duration
2. ease [gsap's ease page](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Eases/CustomEase)
3. colours of background elements
